### Usage

Authentication
The app uses a custom hook useAuth to manage login. Once a user logs in with their email and password, a token is stored in the state and used for subsequent API requests.
Timetable and Courses.

Upon successful login, the student's timetable and registered courses are fetched automatically using the useTimetable and useCourses hooks, respectively.
The timetable is displayed in the Timetable component, and the registered courses are shown in the RegisteredCourses component.
Download Timetable as PDF.

The Download Timetable as PDF button triggers the downloadTimetableAsPDF utility to save the timetable as a PDF file.
API Integration

The application communicates with a backend API to authenticate the user and fetch the student's timetable and courses. The API endpoint used for login is:
POST http://localhost:8082/api/v1/auth/login

The request body should contain:

{
"email": "student@example.com",
"password": "your-password"
}
